**Open project**
Open the Task_2.sln file with Visual Studio 2022 and all the properties and settings should be automatically adjusted.
There is also a binary, including the ".exe" to start the program (probably exclusive for Windows users).

If this does not work, follow this instructions:

Create a new solution file: Open Visual Studio and go to File -> New -> Project. Select "Blank Solution" and enter a name for the new solution file. Click "Create".

Add the Monogame project to the solution: Right-click on the solution file in the Solution Explorer and select "Add" -> "Existing Project". Navigate to the folder where the Monogame project files are located and select the .csproj file. Click "Open".

Build the project: Build the project by clicking on "Build" -> "Build Solution" in Visual Studio. This will generate the necessary binaries and dependencies.

Run the project: Run the project by clicking on the "Start" button in Visual Studio or by pressing F5. The Monogame application should launch.
